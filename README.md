# ZORK - Simple Game Assignment
## 1. Description
It is a C ++ programming exam with Visual Studio which consists on a single exercise where a small conversational game is implemented, starting from a base code. The purpose of this test is to prove that the programming level is appropriate to follow the course. 

## 2. Authors
The main author is me, Javier Castaño, whose intention is to pass the test and be part of the Advanced Programming for AAA Video Games master's degree at the UPC School.

## 3. How to play
It follows the gameplay style from the original Zork!, with little few changes. It works with the following commands:

- `<direction> | go <direction>: Move to another room (examples: 'go north', 'n').`
- `look: Examine the actual room and its entities.`
- `take <object>/get <object>: Grab an object.`
- `open <object>: Open an object (if possible).`
- `inventory: Check items you carry.`
- `unlock <dirección>: Unlock a door at the corresponding direction (hint: you probably need a key).`
- `quit: Exit the game.`
- `restart: Restart the game.`
- `drop: Drop an object.`
- `Put <object> in <object>: Put an object inside another one (if possible).`
- `Read <object>: Read an object like a note or a letter.`
- `Move <object>: Move an object which is acting as an obstacle.`

## 4.Objective
Your objective is to move through the rooms, unlocking doors, taking objects and even defeating enemies until you get to the end.

Here is a map to guide yourself during the game:
